ResumeDom is a Codex skill for reviewing, rewriting, tailoring, and generating evidence-backed US technology resumes.

> One source of truth for career facts; one focused resume for each application.

## Quick start 

Ask Codex to install skill directly from GitHub:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install https://github.com/weeelin98/ResumeDom/tree/main/resume-reviewer
```

Start with one of these prompts:

```text
Use $resume-reviewer to assess this resume without rewriting it yet.
```

```text
Use $resume-reviewer to build a verified Core Resume Record from my resume, notes, and repositories.
```

```text
Use $resume-reviewer to tailor my Core Resume Record to this job description and return editable LaTeX.
```

Skill becomes available on next Codex turn after installation.

### Bundled installer

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py" \
  --repo weeelin98/ResumeDom \
  --path resume-reviewer
```

Installer places skill at `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/resume-reviewer`. Existing destination must be moved or removed before reinstalling.

### Development checkout

Use a symbolic link when local `git pull` updates should become available without reinstalling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weeelin98/ResumeDom.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/ResumeDom/resume-reviewer" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/resume-reviewer"
```

Create link only when destination does not already exist. Start a new Codex turn after installing or updating skill.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Resume, notes, repositories] --> B[Evidence audit]
    B --> C[Core Resume Record]
    C --> D[Job requirement map]
    D --> E[Application Resume]
    E --> F[Markdown / LaTeX / PDF]
```

Core Resume Record remains factual source of truth. Each Application Resume is a separate selection optimized for one role, never a rewrite of source facts.

## What it does

| # | Capability | Result |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Resume assessment** | Diagnoses ATS readability, evidence quality, relevance, wording, credibility, privacy, and layout without pretending to predict an objective ATS score. |
| 2 | **Resume rewriting** | Improves bullets, technical clarity, tense, and section structure while preserving source truth. |
| 3 | **Core Resume Record generation** | Converts resumes, notes, repositories, and candidate answers into `VERIFIED`, `NEEDS CONFIRMATION`, and `DO NOT USE` evidence. |
| 4 | **Application Resume generation** | Selects strongest verified evidence for one concise, reverse-chronological application. |
| 5 | **Job-description tailoring** | Maps requirements to proof as `DIRECT`, `ADJACENT`, or `GAP`. |
| 6 | **Role-competency mapping** | Extracts evidence for frontend, backend, full-stack, AI/ML, data, cloud/DevOps/SRE, mobile, product, and project/program roles. |
| 7 | **Credibility safeguards** | Blocks invented titles, dates, tools, metrics, users, ownership, deployments, and outcomes. |
| 8 | **Automated validation** | Checks Skills placement, articles, forbidden verbs, first-person language, filler, placeholders, bullet length, and repeated opening verbs. |
| 9 | **Editable LaTeX generation** | Produces reusable `.tex` source and PDF preview when a compatible compiler is available. |

## Two resume modes

| | Core Resume Record | Application Resume |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Preserve complete, truthful career evidence | Win consideration for one specific role |
| **Audience** | Candidate and resume agent | Recruiter, hiring manager, and ATS |
| **Scope** | All relevant verified history plus unresolved questions | Strongest job-relevant verified evidence only |
| **Length** | No one-page requirement | Concise; normally one page for interns and new grads |
| **Status** | `Not for Submission` | Application-ready after final audit |
| **Relationship** | Immutable factual source | Derived output; never changes Core facts |

### Application Resume defaults

- No Summary.
- No coursework.
- University/company left and city right.
- Degree/official title on second row and dates right.
- Exactly 3 bullets for every included Experience entry.
- 2–4 project bullets based on verified evidence.
- Skills at very end.

## Opinionated project rules

These repository-specific rules intentionally override generic resume conventions:

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Skills placement | `Skills` appears at very end. |
| English articles | Remove every standalone `a`, `an`, and `the` from resume prose. |
| Forbidden verbs | Never use `led`, `managed`, or `architected` in final resume content. |
| Tense | Use past tense for experience and project bullets. |
| Evidence | Never invent metrics, tools, dates, ownership, deployments, or outcomes. |
| Metrics | Use verified metrics without an artificial percentage cap; add baseline, timeframe, or scope when needed. |

## Editable LaTeX output

Template: [`resume-reviewer/assets/latex/application-resume.tex`](resume-reviewer/assets/latex/application-resume.tex)

Template uses ATS-readable single-column layout, one-line contact block, reusable resume macros, and Times New Roman when installed with TeX Gyre Termes fallback.

```bash
cp resume-reviewer/assets/latex/application-resume.tex application-resume.tex
xelatex application-resume.tex
```

Tectonic is also supported:

```bash
tectonic -X compile application-resume.tex
```

Copy template before adding personal information. Bundled asset must remain generic.

## Validate a Markdown resume

```bash
python3 resume-reviewer/scripts/validate_resume.py path/to/resume.md
```

Validator supplements human review; it cannot prove factual accuracy.
